# CH32V003 Soft Latching Power Circuits

The Soft Latching Power Circuit is ideal for battery-powered applications, as it draws no current once the system is powered down.

## Schematic

![Alt text](schematic/CH32V003_Soft_Latching/CH32V003_Soft_Latching.png)

- `R1` and `C1` hold `Q1` in the off state, while `R2` keeps `Q2` turned off.
- Pressing the button `SW1` pulls the gate of `Q1` low, allowing power to reach the MCU.
- Once powered, the MCU configures `PC7` as an input with the internal pull-up resistor, which latches both `Q1` and `Q2` on.
- The MCU can also monitor the state of the button through pin `PC7`.
- To shut down the circuit, the MCU configures `PC7` as an input with the internal pull-down resistor, turning off both `Q1` and `Q2`.


## Notes

The circuit works flawlessly with the CH32V003!

Initially, I tested it with the CH552, but it never operated reliably. This is likely due to the CH552â€™s GPIOs defaulting to quasi-bidirectional mode (typical for 8051 cores), which includes an internal pull-up resistor. As a result, `Q2` may not be fully turned off. In contrast, the CH32V003 GPIOs default to high-impedance input mode, which avoids this issue.
